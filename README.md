# 📸 Photography Portfolio Website

This is more than just a frontend web development project — it's a digital gallery created to showcase my passion and skills in photography. Designed and developed entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this portfolio blends aesthetic design with personalized expression.

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a **creative portfolio** for my photography work, providing a professional yet artistic platform to display my shots. While it demonstrates my front-end development capabilities, it also reflects my visual storytelling skills and eye for design.

## 🎨 Features

- **Custom Color Palette:** Inspired by Gucci’s elegant green, red, and biscuit tones to evoke a luxury brand feel.
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for all screen sizes — from desktops to mobile.
- **Minimalistic Design:** Clean, distraction-free layout to keep the focus on the photographs.
- **Gallery Sections:** Organized collections for different photography themes.
- **Smooth User Experience:** Simple navigation and clean typography for effortless browsing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (custom styling, no frameworks)  
- JavaScript (for interactivity)

## 💡 What Makes It Special

Unlike typical frontend projects, this website isn't just a design demo — it’s a **live representation of my creative work** as a photographer. Every image, layout decision, and color choice reflects my artistic vision and personality.
